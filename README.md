# My Awesome Project

Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SaSS, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript

Used bootstrap along with third party libraries to add preloader animations, hover animations, scroll animations, and unique progress markers to highlight any section you scroll to in the sticky navigation. Something fun and light to play around with to demonstrate my front end skill while showcasing my full stack development capabilities.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that you can't rely on a resume alone, you need to show what you can do in many ways! I had the most fun with the preloader for animations not just optimizations.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
